# Movie Search Project for Code Institute Milestone 2 Project

## Created by Brian Smyth

# About

With the popularity of streaming services for movies and TV shows, this site is created to serve as a cross-reference for titles. It will also offer the current trending titles in the form of a chart of the top 250 titles of either TV productions or Movies. The site will also offer a the option to keep a wishlist - a user-updated list of titles they want to watch in the future - with the ability to strike-out titles as watched or the option to delete from the list.


## User Experience

As a visitor to the site, I want an immediately accessible search function on either desktop, laptop or mobile device.  I want to be able to research movie titles beyond the brief synopsis offered by services such as Netflix or DisneyPlus Star. 

> I want an easily understood page, with obvious functionality
> Navigation must be plain, uncomplicated and user friendly to any age or ability.
> I like a classic movie theme to enhance the enjoyment of the site visit. 
> If I need to access external resources to help my search, I want to easily return to this site. 
> I want to be able to save items of interest so I can come back to the page and consult my own previous choices. 
> I want a site that I can spend time browsing on or equally, visit quickly and leave with what I came for. 
> I want to be able to contact the website with feedback.

## Site Features

#### Top 

The uppermost section of the page will contain the logo to the left. This will be text-based and subtle to cause minimal distraction.  

The top right of the page will contain four navigation links for the overall site content. 

The body of the page will contain two parts. The top section containing the input fields, and the bottom section to hold any output from the movie choices or for the Wishlist contents. 

In mobile view, the navigation links become activated by a hamburger bar icon with the navigation links offered as full width bars to easily click on. 


## Landing page

This is the search page, the reason the user visits the site.  A jumbotron will offer the search bar so the user will immediately and intuitively be able to proceed.  The search bar uses the API for the IMDb database of movies and TV shows. 

Upon searching, the lower section of the page will offer a grid of every movie related to the title that was searched for. 

The result will contain any poster image that IMDb has on file, the movie title and description. The result will also offer the link to the official IMDB page for that particular movie, which will open in a page separate to our site.
